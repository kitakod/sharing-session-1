# Notes
This repo is made specifically to compile all notes related to the sharing session .

Feel free to clone, edit, and make a pull request to add your personal notes. 

It will be very beneficial to others as well.

If this is your first time using github, no worries! We get you covered. Please refer to the step by step below to make your first contribution :).

# Steps to make your first contribution
- We are using fork and branch workflow to receive any contribution. Please refer to this docs for more details https://blog.scottlowe.org/2015/01/27/using-fork-branch-git-workflow/.
- If you still don't really understand how to use it, please mention us in twitter (@kitakod). We are more than happy to assist :).

## Detail for changes
- There will be folder for each session and if you want to add your notes, please add it into the folder and use your name as the filename (example: if your name is ali, please name it as ali.md).
- We also suggest to write the notes in markdown format as github will automatically detect and show the preview but if you save it in any other format, it's also completely fine.
